    These are the instructions for verifying the signed distributions. Probably you
    won't need to touch this section.
    
-->

<releaseVerification>

<p>It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded
files using the PGP and MD5 signatures.  MD5 verification ensures the
file was not corrupted during the download process.  PGP verification
ensures that the file came from a certain person.</p>

<p>The PGP signatures can be verified using
<a href="http://www.pgpi.org/">PGP</a> or
<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>.
First download the Apache Derby
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk/KEYS">KEYS</a>
as well as the <code>asc</code> signature file for the particular
distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate
trusted source - the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror.
Then verify the signatures using ...</p>

<pre>
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

</pre>

<p>To verify the MD5 signature on the files, you need to use a program
called <code>md5</code> or <code>md5sum</code>, which is
included in many unix distributions.  It is also available as part of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html">GNU
Textutils</a>.  Windows users can get binary md5 programs from <a
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">here</a>, <a
href="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/freeware/console/">here</a>, or
<a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you verify your downloads with both PGP and MD5.</p>
